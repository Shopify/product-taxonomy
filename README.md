## 🧭 Getting started

This repository is the home of Shopify's Standard Product Taxonomy. It houses the source-of-truth data, the distribution files for implementation, and the source code that makes this all sing.

We've structured it to be as user-friendly as possible, whether you're looking to integrate the taxonomy into your own system, suggest changes, or delve into how it's developed and maintained.

### 🧩 How to integrate with the taxonomy: `dist/`

Dive straight into `dist/` to find the files you need and integrate this taxonomy into your system.

We're working on a variety of formats to make it easy to integrate with your systems. Today we have `txt` and `json` formats, and we're working on more. If you have a specific format you'd like to see, please open an issue and let us know!

### 🧑🏼‍🏫 How to make changes to the taxonomy: `data/`


> **🔵 Note**: While we are in preview we are not actively seeking PRs.

Everything comes from the source-of-truth in `data/`. This is where you can submit PRs to change the taxonomy itself.

### 👩🏼‍💻 How to evolve the system: `dev/`

Dive deep by hopping straight into `dev/` to see how the taxonomy is generated and maintained. This is where the magic happens.

For more information, see the [dev readme](./dev/README.md)

## 📅 Releases

We'll manage releases on Github and generally follow [semver](https://semver.org/). You can always find the current version in [`VERSION`](./VERSION).
