It looks like your pull request changes taxonomy \`data/*\` files, but is missing updates to \`dist/*\` files.<br /><br />**⏭️ How to fix**<br />Make a PR comment of \`/generate_dist\`, and I will fix this for you :robot:. Alternatively, you can run \`make\` locally and commit the changes yourself."
